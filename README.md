# NightFall: The Last Bastion

The sun shattered three centuries ago. We don't know why, and we don't know how. We only know what followed: The Eternal Night, and with it, the Void.

When the light died, the demons came. They emerged from the cracks in reality—twisted, shadow-wreathed horrors that hunger for life, for warmth, for the very memory of the sun. Humanity was consumed. Cities fell in hours. Nations in days.

Now, only one fortress remains.

We call it The Bastion. It is built upon the Incendium Core, the last fragment of the sun that fell to earth. Its warmth keeps the ice at bay. Its light keeps the demons back. But the Core is fading. The cold is creeping in. And the Void Swarm grows bolder with every passing cycle.

You are the Commander. The last hope of a dying species.

Your duty is simple, yet impossible: Manage the survivors. Gather what meager resources the frozen earth still yields. Research ancient technologies to strengthen our walls. And when the horns sound—stand.

You must hold the line. You must protect the Core. Because if this light goes out... there will be no dawn.

Welcome to the end of the world. Good luck, Commander.
